# beanFactory Native


I present my ongoing personal project developed in React Native, initially conceived as part of the SE380 React Native course, now serving as a platform for refining my React skills.

Key highlights of this project include:
- **Implementation of Typescript**: Leveraging the robustness and type safety offered by Typescript to ensure a more reliable and maintainable codebase.
- **Nested Navigation**: Employing nested navigation structures to enhance user experience and streamline app navigation flow.
- **Integration of Expo SDK**: Utilizing the powerful capabilities of the Expo SDK, I've seamlessly integrated essential functionalities such as making HTTP requests and incorporating Expo SDK components to enrich the app's features. 
- **Dynamic Animation**: Enhancing user engagement through dynamic animations, albiet a small amount however less is more!

I am eager to discuss the project in more detail and demonstrate how it aligns with the requirements and expectations of your esteemed organization.
