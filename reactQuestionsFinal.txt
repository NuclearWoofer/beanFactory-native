React Native Final  Presentation 
What did you build?
* A photo gallery app that is supposed to have CRUD functionality using the Imgur API.


Why did you build it?
* One of my hobbies include miniature or model painting. I wanted to build something that could host my work.


What SDKs or libraries did you use?
* ImagePicker SDK
* Firebase


Did you use anything we didn't cover in class?
* Not really. Firebase might be one of those things. Google's storage solution, pretty lightweight and easy to integrate.


What was the most difficult part or the most time consuming?
* Before I switched back to Firebase, I was trying to use the Imgur API. I could not get the Update, Upload, and Delete functionality to work. I kept getting forbidden errors that were holding me back but was unable to find a solution. Unsure if this is an Imgur permissions thing or a lack of authorization from Imgur’s part.


What did you find easy to accomplish?
* Firebase was easy to use, the documentation really helped. 


Answer any follow up questions from students or the instructor.
* No, not really. Will hopefully continue to push this and fix it up so I can present this to future employers.
