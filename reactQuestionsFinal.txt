React Native Final  Presentation 
What did you build?
* A photo gallery app that is supposed to have CRUD functionality using the Imgur API.


Why did you build it?
* One of my hobbies include miniature or model painting. I wanted to build something that could host my work.


What SDKs or libraries did you use?
* ImagePicker SDK
* Axios Library


Did you use anything we didn't cover in class?
* Not really. Pretty sure axios was covered in the previous React class.


What was the most difficult part or the most time consuming?
* Getting the Update, Upload, and Delete functionality to work. I kept getting forbidden errors that were holding me back but was unable to find a solution. Unsure if this is an Imgur permissions thing or a lack of authorization from Imgur’s part.


What did you find easy to accomplish?
* Setting up the Gallery and the initial pull from Imgur.


Answer any follow up questions from students or the instructor.
* No, not really. Will hopefully continue to push this and fix it up so I can present this to future employers.
